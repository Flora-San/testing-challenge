# Testing challenge

The technical test is composed of 2 exercises.

  1. Exercise 1: To assess the candidate knowledge on how to test an API.
  2. Exercise 2: To assess the candidate knowledge on how to test a web site

There is a folder per exercise with the corresponding instructions inside.

## Exercise 1: Testing challenge in an REST API

A very simple and basic REST API for a Book Store. It is coded in Flask. The candidate needs to write all the positive and negative test cases to verify the quality of this API and find any potential bugs.

## Exercise 2: Testing challenge in an UI

A very simple website to test the speed of any provided website. The candidate needs to create the test suite to assess the speed test functionality (the url input and the 'start test' button).

## Deliver the exercises

Fork the repository and commit your changes.
Send an email with the fork url to Idoven when the technical test is done.

Thanks and good luck!
